# Lustre

Lustre is a parallel distributed high performance file system for clusters 
ranging from small to large-scale as well as multi-site systems. The 
role of Lustre is to chunks up files into data blocks and spreads file data 
across multiple storage servers, which can be written to and read from in 
parallel.

##Â Lustre Building Blocks

A Lustre file system has three major functional units that provided as a 
simplified diagram below.

</figure>

- One or more **metadata servers (MDS)** that has one or more **metadata targets 
  (MDT)** per Lustre file system that stores namespace metadata, such as 
  filenames, directories, access permissions, and file layout
- One or more **object storage servers (OSS)** that store file data on one or 
  more **object storage targets (OST)**
- **Clients** that access and use the data

## File Striping

One of the main factors leading to the high performance of Lustre file systems 
is the ability to stripe data across multiple storage targets (OSTs). This means
that files are split into chunks which are then distributed among the OSTs. Read
and write operations on striped files will access multiple OST's concurrently. 
As a result, I/O performance is improved since writing or reading from multiple
OST's simultaneously increases the available I/O bandwidth.

    (stripe size = 1m) in size. Each OST store 2 stripes.

</figure>

File striping will predominantly improve performance for applications doing 
serial I/O from a single node or parallel I/O to a single shared file from 
multiple nodes. This behaviour is usually found in application using MPI-I/O, 
parallel HDF5 and parallel NetCDF.

### Set the Striping Pattern 

The striping for a file or directory can be set using the command 
`lfs setstripe`.

```
lfs setstripe --stripe-count <count> --stripe-size <size> <dir|file>
```

where `<count>` set the number of stripes, i.e. the number of OSTs and `<size>`
the size of the stripes. The argument of the `lfs setstripe` command is path to 
a directory or a file:

- if a directory is used, it sets the default layout for new files created in 
  the directory. This default layout can be then be changed for individual files
  inside the directory by creating them with the `lfs setstripe` command
- a new file with the specified layout will be created if a file is passed to 
  the command

### Get the Striping Pattern 

Information about the striping of a directory or a file can be retrived using
the `lfs getstripe` command.

```
$ lfs setstripe --stripe-count=4 --stripe-size=2m /scratch/user/test
$ touch /scratch/user/test/file.txt
$ lfs getstripe /scratch/user/test/
/scratch/user/test/
stripe_count:  4 stripe_size:   2097152 pattern: raid0 stripe_offset: -1

$ lfs getstripe /scratch/e1000/olouant/test/file.txt
/scratch/user/test/file.txt
lmm_stripe_count:  4
lmm_stripe_size:   2097152
lmm_pattern:       raid0
lmm_layout_gen:    0
lmm_stripe_offset: 14
        obdidx           objid           objid           group
            14        46050141      0x2beab5d                0
             1        45873824      0x2bbfaa0                0
             3        45885822      0x2bc297e                0
             5        46052767      0x2beb59f                0
```

In the example above, you can see that `file.txt` inherited the layout of its
parent directory and that the file is striped on 4 OSTs (14, 1, 3 and 5).
