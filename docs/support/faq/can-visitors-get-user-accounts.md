#Can (foreign) visitors in research groups get academic CSC user accounts?

Visitors can apply for the CSC user accounts normally for their academic work. Please see our free-of-charge use cases and usage policy.  

If they have a Haka or Virtu account, they can create a CSC account by themself.
If they don't have a Haka or Virtu account, please see how to contact us.

Please see the Accounts section and general information about getting started with CSC services for more information.
