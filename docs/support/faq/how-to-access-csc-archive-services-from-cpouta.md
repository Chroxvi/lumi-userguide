# How to access the CSC archive service from cPouta?

If you have an account with access to CSC's archive service (HPC-archive) or the to the IDA storage service, you can install an iRODS client and send your data to these archive systems. This is only intended for long term storage of scientific datasets. At this time much of the information about IDA is only in the Finnish language but it is possible to read using Google Translate. See:

*   HPC environment Archive user guide - useful once you have installed the IRODS client
*   Using IDA in Pouta - Examples how IDA wroks in Puhti.
*   CSC IDA service - General information about Ida.
*   Service application process and contact information
*   IDA downloads and installation instructions
