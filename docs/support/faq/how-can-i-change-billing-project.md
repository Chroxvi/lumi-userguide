# How can I change which project is billed for my usage?

This depends on which of your services you are using. In each service, you
start by selecting the project first.

* In supercomputer jobs, you select the billing project in the batch script. There is a separate documentation for Puhti and Mahti
* In Allas, you
  use the allas-conf command to determine which project is used.
* In cPouta or ePouta, you select the project from the Horizon's dropdown list.
* In Rahti,
  OpenStack projects are mapped to CSC projects using the Description
  of the OpenStack project.
