# Overview

In order to run your application on the compute nodes you must submit them 
through a job scheduling system. LUMI uses Slurm as job scheduler.

- Not familiar with Slurm? Go through the [Slurm quickstart][slurm-quickstart]
- Already a Slurm veterant? Checkout our example [batch job scripts][batch-jobs]
- Run on the compute nodes interactively with an [interactive job][interactive]
- See how to submit a large number of independent jobs with [job arrays][job-array]
